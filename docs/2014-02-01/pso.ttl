        """PSO, the Publishing Status Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL for characterizing the publication status of a document or other publication entity at each of the various stages in the publishing process (e.g.  draft, submitted, under review, rejected, accepted for publication, proof, published, Version of Record, catalogued, archived).

Because it is based on the Time-indexed Value in Context ontology pattern (http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc), it is easy to extends the set of specified statuses, simply by adding new individual to the class pso:Status or its sub-class pso:PublicationStatus.

The term Gratis Open Access thus signifies absence of a price barrier to view.  While both imply ‘free’ (a potentially ambiguous word), Gratis Open Access equates to ‘free as in beer’ while Libre Open Access (q.v.) equates to ‘free as in speech’.  Gratis Open Access is thus a necessary but not a sufficient condition for true Libre Open Access.   Many ‘open access’ publications by commercial scholarly publishers are only Gratis Open Access, while almost all publications by ‘pure’ Open Access scholarly publishers are Libre Open Access.
